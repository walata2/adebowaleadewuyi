# About Me

 My name is Adebowale Adewuyi. I graduated from Virginia Union University(VUU) as a Biology major. After graduating I enrolled into a programming bootcamp where I learned TSQL programming, and since then I have been working as a SQL Developer and as Senior Consultant. 

 I am currently enrolled at Old Dominion University for my Masters Program in Data Science & Analytics, and i will be showcasing some of my projects learned in this program as times goes on.
